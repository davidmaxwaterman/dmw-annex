# What's this branch about

The main objective is to get some experience of React, and so be able
to interview on it and land a job.

I also have it in mind to simultaeously practice TDD, or BDD.

# What's the plan

I'm not sure I'd call it a plan, but I want to develop tests that will
help me maintain this application in the future.

Until the time of writing, I've just been playing with React and getting
an idea of how to make things work. It seems like the React Testing
Library is quite strictly focused on unit testing, and isn't set up for
testing things like layout and appearance. As such, I've decided to try
to concentrate on that style of test for now, with a mind to create HTML
that is well structured, and add the visual style/appearance later, as
well as the tests for that (which would probably be more in line with
what I'm used to from Google Lit).

I really like the idea of progressive enhancement. For this game, I'd
imagine it could be totally textual and then add images for decoration
and white/black pieces, etc.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
